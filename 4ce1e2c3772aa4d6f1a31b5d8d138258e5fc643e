      "message": "Currently, the IPMI FRU write commands only is supported in storagecommands.cpp file. Therefore, I add one more build option to support to compile storage commands in libipmi20 library. This option is necessary in case users want to fully support IPMI FRU commands but still use static configuration for sensor commands.\n\nPlease help me to review this commit.",
