If you are looking to trim the size of the library, I guess that is fine, but before we remove things, we need to give the users a grace period  by marking them as deprecated:\n\n[[deprecated(\"Unused internally, marked for removal after 2025-03-30 unless disputed\")]]\n\nPut that line in front of the function declarations to mark them as deprecated.",
