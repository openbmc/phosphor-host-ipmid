      "message": "The ipmi spec seems to think that there is a way to set this on a per-sensor basis with SDRs. Although, with the OpenBMC setup, if the DBus sensor set command fails, maybe that sensor doesn\u0027t support this, so I guess the SDRs would only be helpful if users would like to know prior to attempting to set something that it will work.\n\nAlso, this is the sort of thing that would be more helpful as a configure option so that it can be set without patching.",

      "message": "+1.  I had a comment in drafts but didn\u0027t hit submit.  This seems odd that IPMI would enforce this.  We should be enforcing this in the sensors themselves, and quanta has patches to add this already.  I suspect IPMI can just \"send the request and ask forgiveness later\" and rely on the return code to determine when to send unsupported back.",
