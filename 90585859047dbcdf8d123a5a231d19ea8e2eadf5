      "message": "I don\u0027t think this change is necessary. This is effectively making a partial call to set user access when creating the user, but there is not sufficient information to set all the values. So the caller will still need to call set user access, wherein they will be specifying the user privilege level.\n\nWhen you create a user, you need to do it as several calls, set the user name, set the access, set the password, and enable (as well as possibly setting the channel access if that has not already been done). Skipping any of these steps will result in a user that is not usable.",

      "message": "I still don\u0027t think this is needed even with 50825. Without this change, the user is created without any privileges on any channel. That seems like the correct way to create a user. Since Set User Access is required to be called anyway, we can require them (using 50825) to set a valid privilege, which then, because openbmc does not have the notion of per-channel-privs, will just be applicable to that user for all channels.",
