      "message": "Someone needs to look at this with a better understanding of boost yield_context coroutines.  I can\u0027t get this to pass on both 1.87 and 1.86 with the same code, nor do I understand it enough to figure out if this is a boost bug we need to file.\n\nSo far as I can tell, to support c++20 coroutines boost::asio::spawn added the ability to potentially return a co_return object.  Because of this, the prototype of spawn became no_discard.  When used with yield_context coroutines, the return type of boost::asio::spawn is void (80% sure of this), but with no_discard, we need to explicitly [[maybe_unused]] the \"returned\" void value.\n\nIf we capture that to a variable, boost 1.86 fails to build (because it actually returns void).  If we don\u0027t capture, we fail the nodiscard check on 1.87.",
