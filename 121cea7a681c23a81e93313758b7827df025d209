      "message": "Because this is getting used by the ipmi provider libraries (libipmi20.so and possibly others), this should really be a part of libipmid.so.\n\nI would suggest adding it to libipmid/utils.cpp and then add a function declaration there as well so you don\u0027t have to \u0027extern\u0027 declare it in the sensor files that use it.\n\nOne last thing, I would prefer returning a reference to the object rather than a pointer. Then it is clear that it will never be NULL.",
