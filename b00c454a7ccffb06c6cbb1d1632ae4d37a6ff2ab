      "message": "this is more than just the contents of your commit message. It looks like a bunch of unrelated fixes in addition to the removal of lto.\n\nI can\u0027t in good conscience remove the lto at this point because unless everyone else has the release stuff working, it will increase binary size for everyone. But the rest of the changes look pretty okay with a cursory inspection. Please split the code changes out from meson change.",

That already enables LTO for all meson projects and AFAIK the only place where binary size is important.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/712284255eefbc7cd4d10ef2383f754c14376fb6/meta-phosphor/conf/distro/include/phosphor-defaults.inc#L154",
