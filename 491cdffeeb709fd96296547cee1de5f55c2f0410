This was discussed on the mailing list, and for the moment overriding is the best option we were able to come up with.  The hope is that having the code in the right repo will allow us to merge to one common solution over time, but rome was not built in a day.\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in helping to iterate, feel free to put patches forward.",
