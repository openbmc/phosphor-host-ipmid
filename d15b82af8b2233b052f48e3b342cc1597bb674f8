      "message": "Hi Vernon, sorry, I misunderstood your comment in another patch.\n\nI think you want to add an extra matches array for so we can assign matched index to specific firmware info. Could you please have a review on patchset 4, and let me is it close to your idea? Thank you.\n\nAlso, as you metioned. it doesn\u0027t have a method to know the how to covert matched data (hex or decimal), so I use 10 based for major \u0026 minor, 16 based for aux bytes.\nShould I add another array for defining each matched data is 10 based or 16 based?",
