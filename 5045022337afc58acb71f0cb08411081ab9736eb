      "message": "I read the above, and I\u0027m not understanding the problem.  ipmitool fru write 0 is going to completely replace the fru.  By design, it is buffered in ipmid such that it can be reverted in the case where an incorrectly formatted FRU is written.  Given the FRU is being completely replaced, I\u0027m not understanding how the temporary difference between what IPMI sees and what FruDevice sees is important?\n\n\nCan you please add some more details, including the actual user use case that this is preventing from working?\n\nPlease answer in your commit message.",
