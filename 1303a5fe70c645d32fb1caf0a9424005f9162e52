Let\u0027s just get the real fix put in and then move on.\n\nThere are a lot of options here.\n1) use some type of IPC to inform other programs linked to libuser_channel that they need to reload. Pick your poison: semaphores, shared memory, dbus signals, pipes, etc.\n2) add a timestamp file or modify the format of the file to incorporate a timestamp. If jffs2 has insufficient resolution, put a microsecond timestamp value into a file.\n3) something else?",
