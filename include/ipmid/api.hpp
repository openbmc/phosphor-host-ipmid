/**
 * @brief add a signal handler
 *
 * This registers a handler to be called asynchronously via the execution
 * queue when the specified signal is received.
 *
 * Priority allows a signal handler to specify what order in the handler
 * chain it gets called. Lower priority numbers will cause the handler to
 * be executed later in the chain, while the highest priority numbers will cause
 * the handler to be executed first.
 *
 * In order to facilitate a chain of handlers, each handler in the chain will be
 * able to return breakExecution or continueExecution. Returning breakExecution
 * will break the chain and no further handlers will execute for that signal.
 * Returning continueExecution will allow lower-priority handlers to execute.
 *
 * By default, the main asio execution loop will register a low priority
 * (prioOpenBmcBase) handler for SIGINT and SIGTERM to cause the process to stop
 * on either of those signals. To prevent one of those signals from causing the
 * process to stop, simply register a higher priority handler that returns
 * breakExecution.
 *
 * @param int - priority of handler
 * @param int - signal number to wait for
 * @param handler - the callback function to be executed
