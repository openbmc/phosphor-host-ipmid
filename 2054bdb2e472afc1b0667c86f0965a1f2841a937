      "message": "From mktime manpage:\n\"\"\"\nThe mktime() function converts a broken-down time structure,  expressed  as local time, to calendar time representation.  The function ignores the values supplied by the caller in the tm_wday and tm_yday  fields.   The  value specified  in  the  tm_isdst field informs mktime() whether or not daylight saving time (DST) is in effect for the time supplied in the tm structure: a positive  value  means  DST is in effect; zero means that DST is not in effect; and a negative value means that mktime() should (use timezone  information  and system databases to) attempt to determine whether DST is in effect at the specified time.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis makes me think that you should just set the tm_isdst appropriately and mktime will give you the correct result. I think setting it to -1 should tell it to use the timezone info and determine DST automatically.",
