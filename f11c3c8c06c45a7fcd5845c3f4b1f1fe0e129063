Maybe this sounds better as \"ambiguousOperationCount\" - as having more than one interface object means there is some question of which types of set are supported?\n\nI don\u0027t think this matters very much, but I\u0027m trying to futureproof against the idea of some third setting type (I don\u0027t know, maybe \"factory reset default\"???) presenting itself that we want to support. Since we expect no more updates to the IPMI spec, it probably doesn\u0027t matter and is fine the way it is.",
