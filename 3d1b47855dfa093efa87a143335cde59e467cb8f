Maybe some additional info can be added to the commit msg.",

      "message": "Motivation for this is in https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/49295\n\nWe should have some compatibility notes like:\n- This changes IPMI so that newly created IPMI users are created with \"User\" privilege.  Before this such users were created with no privilege.  You should warn BMC administrators about this change.\n- If your system has an upgrade path and users who have no privilege, you should have a plan to handle that.  For example, your upgrade path might delete no access users, or change their access to user privilege.",
