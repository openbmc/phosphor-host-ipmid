      "message": "I took a quick look at the numbers on a particular system I have using blob read:\n* The Max transfer size of the particular channel is 64 bytes.\n* When transferring Blobs, the maximum IPMI response size is 59 bytes (3 bytes OEN, 2 bytes CRC, 54 bytes blob payload).\n* If the max IPMI response size for FRU read is also 59 bytes, the max read count would be 58 and not 63. I wonder if we need to also subtract 5 from readCount to account for the overhead?",

      "message": "Took another look, the reason a blob read payload is capped to 54 bytes is due to:\n```\n(BlobManager::read)\n    handler-\u003eread(session, offset,\n                  std::min(maximumReadSize, requestedSize));\n\n```\n`maximumReadSize` is defined as `btTransportLength - (btReplyHdrLen + oem::groupMagicSize + crcSize);` here: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-ipmi-blobs/blob/master/manager.hpp#L26\n\nBT has a 5-byte long header, as is described in btbridged: NetFN, cmd, cc, LUN, seq.\nFor KCS, the header is 3-byte long as is described in kcsbridged: NetFN|LUN, cmd, cc.\n\nSo I think maybe we need to determine the header length and subtract it from the getChannelMaxTransferSize and then sutbtract sizeof(uint8).",
