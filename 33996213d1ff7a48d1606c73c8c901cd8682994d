      "message": "Ivan, this implementation, compared to the original one, loses the difference between the case when we truly do not support Boot Mailbox functionality, and the case when something went wrong (dbus call throwed) and we can\u0027t be sure whether the functionality is actually supported or not.\n\nThe original implementation defaulted the IPMI completion code to IPMI_CC_PARM_NOT_SUPPORTED and didn\u0027t touch it in this (and other similar functions) if it succeeded in reading the status from dbus. If, on the other hand, there was an error in reading from dbus and it hit the `catch` block, it would alter the completion code to IPMI_CC_UNSPECIFIED_ERROR to indicate it to the user that something wrong has happened and we can\u0027t tell if mailbox is supported.\n\nPlease verify your implementation of this and other similar functions and restore handling for those two different flavors of `false`.",
