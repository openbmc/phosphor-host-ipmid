I would like to see more of a history of reviewing. As an maintainer of a repo, you will need to do a lot of reviewing, which is a thankless task (not nearly as much fun as writing new code :) ). Show me a history of 20 reviews so I can see your work and investment in reviewing and I am happy to have you join us.",
