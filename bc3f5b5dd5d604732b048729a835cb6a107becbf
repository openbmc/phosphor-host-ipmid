      "message": "I did try that. getSensorMap checks that the sensorPath (2nd arg) is in the sensorConnection (2nd arg). At this point we don\u0027t have the sensorPath for the config on entity manager -- the sensor path we have is for the actual sensor eg xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/sensor. We can get the config path by pulling out a chunk of code from updateIpmiFromAssociation into a separate function, but the check to see if the path (in our case config path) is in the connection fails. \n\nI don\u0027t know this code base well enough to see another way around this -- it doesn\u0027t seem right to go changing the behaviour of getSensorMap or what\u0027s in the SensorCache just so we can get the hysteresis.",
