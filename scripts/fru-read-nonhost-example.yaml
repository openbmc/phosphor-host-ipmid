# A YAML similar to this example would have to be generated, for eg with MRW
# inputs and system configuration, to depict IPMI Fru information.
#
# This file maps IPMI properties to phosphor dbus inventory properties
#
# This YAML could help generate C++ code.
# Format of the YAML:
# Fruid:
#   Associated Fru paths
#     d-bus Interfaces
#       d-bus Properties
#         IPMI Fru mapping
