      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t the normal answer to this be to put the information in an entity-manager exposes record and key off that?\n\nI only comment that, because this is coming up in another review for adding ipmb-capable sensors.  It sounded like Jayashree was already getting started on defining that interface, maybe there\u0027s some synergy to be had between those two patches, where ipmid could read directly from entity-manager?\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/38905",

      "message": "A device that was never in the IPMI channel config file won\u0027t have the ability to handle IPMI commands. The network interface could be fully functional due to kernel initialization and IPMI won\u0027t be able to interact with that network device.\n\nIf the device fails to enumerate what corrective action is IPMI going to apply? What corrective action is entity-manager going to apply? The kernel has failed to enumerate and create the device. The only user level correction of this I can imagine is to replace the network device in the event it is a user replaceable item, and then reboot the BMC. The only other corrective action I can think of in this case is to be applied by the OEM vendor.",
