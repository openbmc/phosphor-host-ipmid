All of the dbus-sensors apps have `org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager` under the `/` path.\nAnd it looks like the `phosphor-health-monitor` is the only OpenBMC app that has `org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager` under the `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors` path.\nIf we would always check both of these paths, most of the time second DBus call would be a waste.",
