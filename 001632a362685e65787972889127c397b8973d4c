      "message": "Each of these makes some assumptions about the regex captures. At the very least the code should check to make sure that the match count is the expected number of matches.\n\nI like the idea of a regex, but I think we need some more work.\n\nSince the aux bytes (13:16) are just bytes, we should probably have those as separate matches and just put them together in order.\n\nSo if the matches are standardized like:\nm[0] \u003d whole match\nm[1] \u003d major\nm[2] \u003d minor\nm[3] \u003d aux[0]\nm[4] \u003d aux[1]\nm[5] \u003d aux[2]\nm[6] \u003d aux[3]\n\nThen we could put together the command response easily. The trouble would be if any of those fields were out of order from version string to match order.\n\nSo maybe we would need to have two regexs, the first to modify the string to put everything in order, and the second to pull matches out.",
