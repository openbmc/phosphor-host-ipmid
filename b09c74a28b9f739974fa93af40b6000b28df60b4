      "message": "Since we\u0027re fixing this function, the current OpenBMC tags do not start with \"v\" anymore, instead they start with the Major number, ex: 2.8.0, 2.9.0. Therefore this ipmi command doesn\u0027t work anymore and displays all 0s for the firmware version.\nCould we fix this as well to not require a \"v\" in the string? Otherwise this change still doesn\u0027t fix the version in the latest OpenBMC.",
