      "message": "Hello Willy,\n\nSorry for breaking the build, and thank you for fixing it, the patch looks good.\n\nI wondered why CI didn\u0027t catch it and it looks like it\u0027s just because dynamic-sensors meson feature is disabled by default (I didn\u0027t realise it when compile-testing locally). It\u0027s probably worth enabling all compile-time options for the CI so that mistakes like this are caught early in the future, what do you think?",
